        For a while there, it was rough
But lately I've been doin' better
Than the last four cold Decembers
I recall
And I see my family every month
I found a girl my parents love
She'll come and stay the night
And I think I might have it all

And I thank God every day
For the girl He sent my way
But I know the things He gives me
He can take away
And I hold you every night
And that's a feeling I wanna get used to
But there's no man as terrified
As the man who stands to lose you

Oh, I hope I don't lose you
Mmm, please, stay
I want you, I need you, oh, God
Don't take
These beautiful things that I've got

Please, stay
I want you, I need you, oh, God
Don't take
These beautiful things that I've got
Oh, ooh
Please, don't take

I found my mind, I'm feelin' sane
It's been a while, but I'm findin' my faith
If everything's good and it's great
Why do I sit and wait till it's gone?
Oh, I'll tell ya, I know I've got enough
I've got peace and I've got love
But I'm up at night thinkin' I just might lose it all

Please, stay
I want you, I need you, oh, God
Don't take
These beautiful things that I've got
Oh, ooh

Please, stay
I want you, I need you, oh, God
I need
These beautiful things that I've got
